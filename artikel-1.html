			<p>Maybe my friends are still confused about why we have to learn programming/coding with difficulty, hmmmm... maybe this article will help friends or motivate friends so that we can consistently learn programming and become successful programmers</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<h2>
					<li>Define your Purpose</li>
				</h2>
					<p>Every human being is not perfect and has advantages or disadvantages of each. Therefore, we must not depend on or follow other people. We have to be what we want, we have to be committed, we have to be independent programmers. developer, android-dev etc. Maybe if we map out how wide the programming world is, there will be no end to it, and the same goes for existing programming languages ​​such as Python (blockchain technology), C++, PHP, JavaScript, or existing frameworks, etc. We as humans must support each other. complete, so don't be confused about what it's all about, it's better my friend "choose one, and focus on it. So friends, "If you want to become a web-developer, instill the mindset of a friend" that making a website is fun!, and it's easy or think if you are able to make a website and the website can be useful for our environment, how do we feel? or those who use our work? ? Surely we feel there is pride in ourselves. So, basically Focus on what you want, and never depend on others!</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Prepare your mentally</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						Prepare mentally, friends, you have to prepare mentally, friends, don't ever feel that coding is narrow, the truth is that coding is very broad, for example: for(let i = 1 ; i>0 ; i++){console.log(i)}. Coding is not what you imagine, if you have finished 4.5 years of college, and you think your knowledge of coding has run out, that's very wrong, because in my opinion coding is like the saying "The more we know, the more we don't know." , ". You have to be tough, you have to be mentally prepared or all the errors you face, and most importantly you have to be strong to face the rapid technological adaptation.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Choose your programming language</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						<img src="assets/img/inspirasi.jpg" alt="konsisten">This is still related to the first list, After you have made your choice, you have to be more committed, make sure it is your choice, because it is almost difficult if you want to be an expert in all fields of technology, and it is almost difficult to become an expert in all fields and remember bruce lee's principle, more or less he said like this; "I'm more afraid of people who have 1 move with 1000x practice, than 1000 moves with 1x practice". Likewise with technology or whatever!. If you already understand what I mean, please understand the roadmap or the learning path that you are involved in.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Look for source lesson beleivable</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						After you know what you are passionate about, friends, please look for learning references that you are engaged in, such as from Youtube, join bootcamps with ISA, Follow Social media about technology, etc. Maybe friends ask where did I learn from? Maybe 90% of it is from youtube, 10% percent is from other articles, Yes because honestly learning on youtube is much more fun and easy to understand, Therefore, there is no reason if we can't become programmer, I have a Youtube channel reference:
					</p>
						<ul class="referensi">
							<li>Web Programming UNPAS</li>
							<li>Programmer Zaman Now</li>
							<li>Kelas Terbuka</li>
							<li>Sekolah Koding </li>
							<li>Kawan Koding</li>
						</ul>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>ATM</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						Maybe my friend is confused, what is an ATM? ATM is an Auto Teller Machine but it's not really, my friend... ATM is Observe Imitating Modification, maybe this is the most effective way to become a programmer because we are forced to think hard, and solve our problem skills keep training. Honestly, sometimes I have a little trouble with this method, especially if the solution is not on stack over-flow or references on youtube, what is stack-overflow?? Yes, in the 2nd article I will explain, but I think that if I don't struggle, I will not be successful, as the saying goes "Be sick first, have fun later"
