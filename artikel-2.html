			<p>Hello friends, how are you?, Maybe you must have experienced errors when learning programming or making applications, hmmm, how does it feel, you must be annoyed, right? If you are annoyed, that's for sure! In this article I have some tips for dealing with these things.</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<h2>
					<li>Peace with Error</li>
				</h2>
					<p>The first of all, you must understand that every programmer or beginner or eventhough professional must have experienced an error. Yes, that's normal." Therefore, we must make peace with the error, what does it mean? like humans, we must have enemies every human being? how do we deal with it, do we just stay silent, don't want to apologize? or how do we want to make peace with it so that we get peace? yes, of course we must introspect ourselves" as well as computers, as well as you, you have to understand slowly", introspect slowly", why the application can be wrong? If the file is corrupt then the application does not run smoothly, whatever it is, every problem has a solution, the solution is to make peace and deal with it with a cool head</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Read Message Error Correctly</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						There are 3 types of errors: Syntax, Semantic, Logical. Honestly, the syntax error is the easiest because it's easy to understand the messages. For example, if you are coding in the JavaScript language, then you don't run the script you want or feel weird. You can go to inspect, there is a red message. Honestly, even though I don't understand what the message is, at least there is a hint or hint in the row for how many errors there are. Likewise in other programming languages, so friends, don't panic if there is an error, make peace with the error like the list above, understand what you want, understand the error message slowly, sure, all problems must have a solution.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Googling Message Erorr</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						After you have done the steps above, please copy + paste the syntax error buddy "and search on stack overflow, articles, or other youtube channels that discuss your error". Friends, I'm sure, before your error existed, programmers at home or abroad have experienced errors that you have experienced and have been solved, for years. Honestly, if I suggest watching it from YouTube, we can follow the steps -by-step slowly" or use a low speed to follow and make sure no rarity is missed.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Make sure Environment and Equipment suit as needed</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						If you have followed the list above, follow these steps. Honestly, this is a bit annoying, and considered trivial, friend, you have to make sure the application version is the latest, because the latest one is much better, because it has been revised many times" and has followed era. Because there are several versions, although the syntax is the same but the running is different.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>
					<li>Ask for others people</li>
				</h2>
					<p>
						This is an ultimatum in my opinion, but friends, make sure you follow the steps above properly, because everything has its ethics, don't just carelessly ask fb forums, tele, etc. Friends, you have to struggle first, follow the steps above, so that other programmers understand that you have tried your best, but the results are not as expected... So friends, you try your best because there are programmers out there, everyone is busy. , and ask in accordance with good etiquette by following the steps above, greet politely.
					</p>
